# Prediction of insurance premium

A construction of machine learning algorithm, that predicts the insurance premium on *Regression with an Insurance Dataset* from *Kaggle's Playgroung Series*.
Predictions generated by the model are in approximately **87th percentile**.

## Methodology
* Exploratory Data Analysis on the train dataset,
* Feature Engineering: creation of simple features dummy combinations and a more refined **target encoding** method,
* Feature Selection: Backward elimination algorithm,
* Model parameters tuning using [Optuna](https://optuna.org/) framework,
* Final model for insurance premium prediction: single regression model using [**XGBoost**](https://xgboost.readthedocs.io/en/stable/python/python_api.html#module-xgboost.sklearn) regressor.

## Frameworks
* [Optuna](https://optuna.org/): Faster than straightforward **grid search** in high dimensional parameters set but still reliable,
* [XGBoost](https://xgboost.readthedocs.io/en/stable/python/python_api.html#module-xgboost.sklearn): Great for a task with a big number of features and complex interactions between them.

## Dataset

[Regression with an Insurance Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/playground-series-s4e12/overview) from *Kaggle's Playgroung Series*.
